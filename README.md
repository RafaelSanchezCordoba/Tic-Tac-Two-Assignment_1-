# Tic-Tac-Two WEB2 Assignment

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It's a two-player game where the players take turns to mark the cells of a 3x3 grid with their symbols (usually X or O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
